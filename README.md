# Basic Payroll System

This project provides core functionalities for a basic payroll system. It allows users to manage employees, departments, process payroll, and generate payslips.

## Functionality

1. **Employee Management**:
   - Users can add new employees by providing details such as name, department, salary, and overtime hours.

2. **Department Management**:
   - Departments can be created to categorize employees.

3. **Payroll Processing**:
   - Employees' salaries and overtime are considered for calculating gross pay.

4. **Payslip Generation**:
   - A basic payslip with employee name, department, and gross pay is generated.

## Methodology

The analysis employs a combination of code inspection and knowledge of OOP principles. The report examines:
- Class definitions and their attributes (data) and methods (functions).
- Object creation and usage.
- Code flow and interaction between different parts.
- Implementation of OOP concepts like encapsulation and polymorphism (limited in this code).

Feel free to enhance this README with additional information, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant details.
