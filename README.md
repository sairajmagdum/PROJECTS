•	Payroll Processing: Employees' salaries and overtime are considered for calculating gross pay.
•	Payslip Generation: A basic payslip with employee name, department, and gross pay is generated.



Methodology:
The analysis employs a combination of code inspection and knowledge of OOP principles. The report examines:
•	Class definitions and their attributes (data) and methods (functions).
•	Object creation and usage.
•	Code flow and interaction between different parts.
•	Implementation of OOP concepts like encapsulation and polymorphism (limited in this code).
